First Steps with PyObs
======================

Getting PyObs
-------------

You can download the latest stable release 
from this link :download:`latest-release-pyobs <../tar/pyobs-0.5.1.tar.gz>`

Install PyObs
-------------

Usage w/o installation PyObs
----------------------------

PyObs can be used also without installing
it in the python library, by following these steps

 1. untar the latest release in a directory, for example `/home/analysis/`::

    $ cd /home/analysis
    $ tar -zxvf pyobs-x.y.z.tar.gz 

 2. execute the file `maker.sh` to compile a fast c library of core functions used in the package; 
    this script requires one argument which is the location of the C compiler::
     
    $ cd /home/analysics/pyobs/pyobs/core
    $ sh maker.sh /usr/bin/gcc

 3. finally, to use the package in a python script simply add the path with::

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path.insert(0,'/home/analysis/pyobs')
    >>> from pyobs import * 

.. warning::
   Make sure to add the path that points to the directory that
   contains the subfolder named ``pyobs``, which is the true package 
   loaded by ``import``. In our example above do not use `/home/analysis/pyobs/pyobs`
