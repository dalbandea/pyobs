# pyobs
=======

A Python library to analyze lattice observables.

   * entirely based on the `numpy` library, with some additional modules written in c
   * objected-oriented with wide basis of overloaded operations
   * flexible calculation of the error with the `Gamma method`
   * analytic propagation of the error for all built-in functions, including fitting routines
   * support for :math:`\chi^2_\mathrm{exp}`
