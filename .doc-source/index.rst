pyobs |release|
================

A Python3 library to analyse data generated
from (Monte Carlo) Markov chains.           

.. The current stable version is |release|

The software is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/mbruno46/pyobs>`__.

Installation
------------

`pyobs` can be installed in three different ways.
After installation it can be imported like any other package

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pyobs
   >>> help(pyobs.obs)

* **pip install from remote repository**

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pip install git+https://github.com/mbruno46/pyobs.git@master#egg=pyobs 
   $ # for upgrading
   $ pip install -U git+https://github.com/mbruno46/pyobs.git@master#egg=pyobs

* **pip install from local repository**


.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone git+https://github.com/mbruno46/pyobs.git
   $ pip install ./pyobs

* **developer mode**

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone git+https://github.com/mbruno46/pyobs.git
   $ cd pyobs
   $ python setup.py build_ext_loc
   $ mv build/lib.*/pyobs/core/mftools.so pyobs/core/
   $ python setup.py develop

The library can alternatively be used without installation
by adding the appropriate path to `sys`.
In this case it is recommended to recompile the C++ extensions
manually. 

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import sys
   >>> sys.path.append('/path/to/pyobs/directory/')
   >>> import pyobs

Note that recompiling the C++ extensions might be necessary
also after pulling the latest commits, in the developer mode.
